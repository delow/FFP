### Old FFP (2v.1.0) version deposit
Saved but not updated

* The script to convert a low triangular asymmetric matrix to a symmetric matrix; ![to_symmetrix.py](old_FFP/to_symmetrix.py) since an old JSD_matrix does not support symmetric matrix output  
* Old string-based FFP programs relabled to version 2v.1.0  
* Recommend to use most updated program
